                        <div class="article-content">
                            <p>Greetings Commanders! While there are no new major developments to report from the past week, this week’s issue brings our first Deep Dive segment. I’ll be diving into one of the most recent new Thargoid deployments - the Hunter Glaive. We also have some more routine news to report, and some advice for CMDRs looking to try out the new Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner.</p>

                        <h3>Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner Public Release</h3>
                        <div class="article-content">
                            <p>With last week’s community goal having reached Tier 1, the Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner (aka the pulse scanner or TPS) is now available for public purchase. This module can be <span class="axiorange">purchased for credits at any rescue megaship</span>.</p>
                            <p>For those that missed last week’s issue, the pulse scanner is a hybrid device that both acts as a regular Xeno Scanner with a 1km range, and also has a function similar to the Pulse Wave Analyzer that reveals various points of interest on a Thargoid Titan. For more information, refer to the following video by GalNet News Digest:</p>

                            <p>This week, the AXI is starting by focusing operations in the Taranis Maelstrom region, with efforts expected to branch out shortly after Taranis is cleared of new invasions.</p>

                        <h2>Deep Dive: Hunter Glaive</h2>
                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            The newest vessel to be seen deployed by the Thargoids, the Glaive is the first variant in a new class: Hunters. While other variants can only be speculated on, they seem to fulfill a role in between full Interceptors and Scouts. Glaives can be encountered in nearly all active Thargoid zones, being found in AX Combat Zones, patrolling Maelstroms, protecting the Titans, and pulling CMDRs out of hyperspace and supercruise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Glaives are usually encountered either alone or in pairs, but wings of up to three can be seen. When encountered, they are instantly hostile, firing a FSD disruptor missile before opening fire with their main cannon.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                        <p>
                            Like Scouts, Glaives have no hearts, and therefore do not have natural hull regeneration. They are the fastest of any known Thargoid vessel, moving somewhere around 750m/s. Initial estimates place their hull at roughly as durable as a Cyclops, but their lack of regeneration makes them significantly easier to kill. They have an estimated 99% resistance to conventional human weapons. Unlike Interceptors, their aim is <span class="axiorange">not deterred by staying below 20% heat</span>. When killed, they drop various Thargoid materials, including the new Caustic Shards that can be found scattered throughout Maelstroms. The Pilots Federation will grant a bond of 4,500,000 credits for a successful kill.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Special Abilities</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Glaive comes with four special abilities: FSD containment missiles, caustic missiles, a unique lightning attack, and an anti-Guardian field similar to the Orthrus Interceptor.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The <span class="axiorange">FSD containment missiles</span> are similar to those employed by human pirates, and unlike most Thargoid weaponry can be affected by human deterrents. Electronic Countermeasures are especially effective, with Point Defense Turrets being functional but not very effective.
                            </li><br/>
                            <li>
                                The Glaive will periodically fire<span class="axiorange">four caustic missiles</span> simultaneously. Their payload is weaker than those of a standard interceptor. These missiles can be evaded with careful maneuvering, but packing Caustic Sinks are recommended to effectively neutralize their effects. As with all Thargoid caustic missiles, ECMs and PDs are useless against these.
                            </li><br/>
                            <li>
                                Glaives possess a <span class="axiorange">unique lightning attack</span>, which they will use whenever they get within 1km of their target. Considering their speed, this will happen often even with careful piloting. This lightning, while not particularly damaging, has the unique property of <span class="axiorange">regenerating the Glaive’s shield</span>. While they are using this attack, they become effectively invulnerable due to the high regeneration of this effect.
                            </li><br/>
                            <li>
                                The last special property of the Glaive is the <span class="axiorange">anti-Guardian field</span>. Similar to Maelstrom systems and Orthrus Interceptors, this field will slowly deal damage to any guardian modules mounted on your ship. Due to this, it is advised to either prioritize killing Glaives or to avoid using guardian technology at all. They deploy the field when attacking, and don't turn it off unless they eliminate all targets.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Recommended Tactics</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are two main tactics that have been discovered to effectively deal with Glaives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When encountered in a hyperdiction or interdiction, <span class="axiorange">enabling silent running quickly will prevent Glaives from getting a target lock</span>. Without this lock, they will merely pursue you at a slower speed, allowing you to wait out your FSD cooldown and make a safe escape. If the Glaive gets a lock, there is nothing you can do to deter them, as they are not deterred by usual cold orbiting mechanics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second tactic is more relevant to wing combat. While charging their lightning attack, Glaives open up a <span class="axiorange">weak spot near their rear engine</span>. Hitting this spot with sustained fire will stun the Glaive, allowing for massive damage to be dealt in a short amount of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to their anti-Guardian field, using human-derived AX weaponry is advised. It should also be noted that should they ram you, they have a surprisingly high mass, which can lead to unexpectedly high collision damage.
                        </p>
