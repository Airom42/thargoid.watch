                            Welcome, Commanders, to the first publication of the Anti-Xeno Initiative's Frontline Debrief! Inspired by CMDR Avasa Siuu's old weekly video debriefs, I, CMDR Airom42, will bring you a summary of the newest and most important news from the Thargoid War each week. This will strive to be as comprehensive and informative as possible, aimed at those who want to stay informed about the newest technology, tactics, and tales from the front in the past week. This will generally be finished by a few days after Thargsday, striving to bring the freshest information as fast as possible.

                        <h2>This Week in the Galaxy</h2>
                        <h3>New Tech - Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner</h3>
                        <div class="article-content">
                            <p>
                                In collaboration with Professor Ishmael Palin, Aegis has developed a new scanner capable of revealing points of interest on a Thargoid Titan's hull. This module works as a hybrid of the Pulse Wave Analyzer and a regular Xeno Scanner, allowing CMDRs to scan smaller thargoid craft and reveal points on the Titan to which a research limpet can be attached.
                                Although a community goal to unlock the module is ongoing, there was a brief period on Friday when the scanner could be purchased. With the completion of the CG, the module will be made available to all CMDRs at all Resue Megaships and will be purchasable with credits.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Community Goals</h3>
                        <div class="article-content">
                            There are two community goals active this week, relating to the new xeno scanner. As is routine, there is a delivery CG and a combat CG to protect the deliveries. This CG will establish Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner availability at all rescue megaships, and grant a free module to the top 25% of contributors in each CG. This CG is run out of Muller Terminal in the Rabh system.

                        <h3>Into the Maw</h3>
                        <div class="article-content">
                            With the early release of the new pulse scanner module, many CMDRs have already begun to analyze Titan’s hull. The scanner has revealed various points of interest to which a research limpet can be docked, allowing for samples to be extracted from the Titan's Hull and Maw. 
                            CMDR Mechan has done some recon and released a short video of the capabilities of the Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner, and the variety of samples that can be obtained from the Titans.

                        <div class="article-content">
                            A record-breaking 59 systems were cleared of Thargoid influence last week. As we enter the war’s 26th week, this is a major victory in stemming the Thargoid expansion. So far this week, over a dozen systems have been cleared, representing efforts mainly in the Raijin and Indra maelstrom regions.

                                As always, everyone's least favorite AX topic: the kind of bug we can’t kill with Gauss. With update 15.1, we saw some issues fixed but a few new ones popped up. Please take a minute to either confirm or upvote the following issues:
