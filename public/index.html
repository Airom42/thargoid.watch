                                <p>Salvation's Proteus Wave weapon has been activated in the system <span class="axiorange">HIP 22460</span>, however due to an unexpected event, severe destruction has been wrought on human ships within the system and Thargoid vessels have been seen in great numbers.</p>
                                <p>So far this is what has transpired after the brief deployment of the Proteus Wave:</p>
                                <ul style="line-height: 1.5;">
                                    <li>All thargoid vessels were inoperable for a brief period; a surge built up from the surface site in planet 10 b; rebooting and bringing up to life all the enemy ships.</li>
                                    <li>All human ships were affected by an EMP-like pulse and their guardian equipment was all fried, this includes guardian powerplants, module reinforcements, and SLFs. The Old AX weaponry is working as expected.</li>
                                    <li>We have received reports that the Guardian Relics can be affected after being plugged into any thargoid terminal; making them now a renewed Unclassified Relic, this "infection" makes them look on a green hue.</li>
                                    <li>When transporting said Unclassified Relics on systems like Arque and Meene; either Ishmael Palin or Ram Tah will ask you to give the tech to them. It is advised to bring at least one Unclassified relic and sell them to the market on each engineer base.</li>
                                    <li>Thargoids in the Pleiades, Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulae are behaving according to within the known parameters. Whilst on foot in HIP 22460 thargoid ships might engage at you.</li>

                                        Date : 08/08/3308<br>
                                        Location : HIP 22460 | Orbiting planet 10b<br>
                                        Name : Commander Xarionn<br><br>
                                        
                                        So this is it, after years of fighting the Thargoids, millions of lives lost and countless sacrifices, we are finally inches away from reaching our goal of driving them off once and for all.<br><br>
                                        Over the past month we’ve been defending Azimuth and their Proteus Wave project, together, the Federation, the Empire and the Alliance for the first time put their differences aside to work hands in hands in order to make this a reality and potentially save billions of lives, this project is Humanity’s greatest hope and yet... Yet some people still can’t see it...<br><br>
                                        They named it « Operation Wych Hunt », their goal was to prevent Salvation and by extension Azimuth, from building the Proteus Wave, fortunately, they failed to do so but caused numerous delays... Which probably caused the death of many brave soldiers who died protecting a dream, our dream...<br><br>
                                        Anyway, what matters now is the future deployment of the Proteus wave, thanks to everyone, the Bright Sentinel is still in one piece and fully operational, the end is near, I can feel it !<br><br>
                                        I’ve be tasked to escort the Bright Sentinel until the deployment of the Proteus wave is complete, the megaship looks safe but we can’t be too prudent. I’ll update this journal tomorrow, after Salvation brings us victory.<br><br>
                                        Commander Xarionn out.<br><br>

                                        Wh-... What happened ? I- My ship went dark, all systems are unresponsive just... just like...<br><br>
                                        This isn’t right, they... The Bright Sentinel was... was destroyed... I... IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE END DAMMIT!<br><br>
                                        ... If you hear this message, I don’t know if I’ll still be alive or.. not but you have to know that we... we failed, we failed everyone. The Proteus wave first worked as expected, all Thargoids were either killed or disabled, there was... People screaming « victory » all over our comm channels but barely a minute after an.. Another pulse came from the Proteus site.<br><br>
                                        I thought it was expected but... But everything went dark, like... Like the weapon turned against us, I survived through sheer luck.. I-.. I shouldn’t be alive.. I watched them die, I swore to protect them... I am... I AM SUPPOSED TO BE A VETERAN so... why !?<br><br>
                                        I am checking the integrity of my modules as I speak, it looks like all my weapons are damaged, beyond repair... How is that possible ? All the Guardian modules I have on board are unusable.. ?<br><br>
                                        Alright... I first need to get out of here, my frame shit drive seems to be functional, thrusters are online as well and I still have enough fuel... I’ll make it, staying here will only lead to my demise.<br><br>
                                        To anyone reading this message, leave this system immediately, the project was a total failure, this green light on the surface of planet 10b could emit another disruptive pulse at any moment.. DO NOT stay in this system !<br><br>

                        <p>The <span class="axiorange">Anti-Xeno Initiative</span> was founded by <span class="axiorange">CMDR Gluttony Fang</span> on 15th of November 3303. We are the largest dedicated AX (Anti-Xeno) player group in Elite:Dangerous and act as a hub for the broader AX Community. We are partnered with <span class="axiorange">Canonn Research</span>, who provide us with the latest findings related to our mission. We also coordinate defense efforts with other player groups to protect as many lives as we can. We constantly strive to get better at what we do and we have some of the best Anti-Xeno experts among us.</p>
                        <p>The membership in AXI is non-binding, meaning you can also be a part of any other player group you wish. We have people of all walks of life and all matter of allegiance. We ourselves are a completely independent and apolitical - we do not support or oppose any faction, power or group, unless they force our hand. That said, we protect our members. We have a sizable contingent of PvP pilots to repel any attempts at disrupting our primary mission.</p>
